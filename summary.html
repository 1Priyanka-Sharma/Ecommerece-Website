require()=      -it reads a JavaScript file
                -executes the file
                -return the exports object

                var example = require('./example.js')
                example = {
                  message: "hi",
                  say: [Function]
                }

Module exports ~ exports are the instructions that tell Node. js which bits of code (functions, objects, strings, etc.) to export from a given file so that other files are allowed to access the exported code.

express.Router()  =When var app = express() is called, an app object is returned. Think of this as the main app.
When var router = express.Router() is called, a slightly different mini app is returned. The idea behind the mini app is that each route in your app can become quite complicated, and you'd benefit from moving all that code into a separate file. Each file's router becomes a mini app, which has a very similar structure to the main app.
